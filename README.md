Dvm is a lightweight, and powerful [Deno](https://deno.land/) version manager for MacOS, Linux, WSL, and Windows with Bash.

For Windows users, you must install DVM v0.7.0 or later versions, and also need to install a bash shell if you want to use this tool. For example, you can install WSL and execute `bash` command in PowerShell.

***Please do not use `deno upgrade` command to upgrade Deno after you had installed Deno with DVM.***

## Installing and Updating

### Installation

There are two ways to install DVM.

1. Install dvm from network by the following command:

```sh
curl -o- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghosind/dvm/master/install.sh" | bash
```

For Chinese user, you can also install it from Gitee by the following command:

```sh
curl -o- "https://gitee.com/ghosind/dvm/raw/master/install.sh" | DVM_SOURCE=gitee bash
```

2. Clone this project and execute `install.sh` script:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/ghosind/dvm.git"
# you can also clone it from gitee
# git clone "https://gitee.com/ghosind/dvm.git"
cd dvm
./install.sh
```

After installed dvm, please restart your terminal or use `source <your_rc_file>` to apply changes.

The default install location is `~/.dvm`, you can use `-d <dir>` option (for local install only) or `$DVM_DIR` environment variable to specify an inexistent directory as the install location.

```sh
curl -o- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghosind/dvm/master/install.sh" | DVM_DIR=~/deno/dvm bash
./install.sh -d ~/deno/dvm
```

### Upgrade DVM

Since DVM `v0.3.0`, we provided `upgrade` command to update your DVM to the latest version.

```sh
dvm upgrade
```

If you want to update the DVM that less than `v0.3.0`, you may need to uninstall the current version and re-install the latest version. You can get the uninstall steps from [Manual uninstall](#manual-uninstall) section.

## Prerequirement

Please make sure you have required dependencies installed:

- curl
- git
- unzip (for Deno v0.36.0 and newer versions)
- gunzip (for Deno v0.35.0 and lower versions)

For installing Deno from source, please make sure you have required dependencies installed:

- rustc
- cargo
- cc
- cmake

## Getting Started

After installed dvm, you can use it to manage multiple version Deno environments.

### List available versions

Use `dvm list-remote` or `dvm ls-remote` to list all available versions from remote.

```sh
# list all available versions
dvm list-remote
# ls-remote is an alias for list-remote command
dvm ls-remote
```

### List installed versions

Use `dvm list` or `dvm ls` to list all installed versions.

```sh
# list all installed versions
dvm list
# ls command is an alias for list command
dvm ls
```

### Install Deno

Use `dvm install <version>` command to download and install a specified version from the source.

```sh
dvm install v1.0.0
# deno v1.0.0 has installed.
# Using deno v1.0.0 now.

dvm install v0.42.0
# deno v0.42.0 has installed.
# Using deno v1.0.0 now.
```

### Install Deno from source

Since DVM v0.8.0, you can install Deno from source with `--from-source` option.

```sh
dvm install --from-source v1.35.0
```

### Uninstall Deno

Use `dvm uninstall <version|alias-name>` command to uninstall a specified version.

```sh
dvm uninstall v0.39.0
# uninstalled deno v0.39.0.

# default is an alias name
dvm uninstall default
# uninstalled deno default.
```

### Set active version

Use `dvm use [version]` command to link `deno` to the specified installed version by parameter or `.dvmrc` file.

```sh
# use v1.0.0
dvm use v1.0.0
# Using deno v1.0.0 now.
```

If you do not specify the active version, DVM will try to read `.dvmrc` file from the current working directory.

```sh
# cat .dvmrc
# # v1.4.0
dvm use
# Found './dvmrc' with version v1.4.0
# Using deno v1.4.0 now.
```

Set active version by `use` command is for a single terminal session only. If you want to set an active version for all terminal sessions, please set a `default` alias to a version. See [Set an alias](#set-active-version) section for more details.

### Get current version

Use `dvm current` command to display the current version of Deno.

```sh
dvm current
# v1.0.0
```

### Set an alias

Use `dvm alias` command to set alias name for a installed version of Deno.

```sh
dvm ls
#    v1.0.0

# Set an alias
dvm alias default v1.0.0
# default -> v1.0.0

dvm ls
#    v1.0.0
# default -> v1.0.0
```

### Run with a version

Use `dvm run` command to run Deno on the specified version with arguments.

```sh
dvm run v1.0.0
# Running with deno v1.0.0
# Deno 1.0.0
# exit using ctrl+d or close()
# >
```

You can also run a script file with the specified version.

```sh
# Run app.ts with Deno v1.0.0
dvm run v1.0.0 app.ts
```
