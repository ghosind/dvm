## Installing and Updating

### Installation

There are two ways to install DVM.

1. Install dvm from network by the following command:

```sh
curl -o- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghosind/dvm/master/install.sh" | bash
```

For Chinese user, you can also install it from Gitee by the following command:

```sh
curl -o- "https://gitee.com/ghosind/dvm/raw/master/install.sh" | DVM_SOURCE=gitee bash
```

2. Clone this project and execute `install.sh` script:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/ghosind/dvm.git"
# you can also clone it from gitee
# git clone "https://gitee.com/ghosind/dvm.git"
cd dvm
./install.sh
```

After installed dvm, please restart your terminal or use `source <your_rc_file>` to apply changes.

The default install location is `~/.dvm`, you can use `-d <dir>` option (for local install only) or `$DVM_DIR` environment variable to specify an inexistent directory as the install location.

```sh
curl -o- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghosind/dvm/master/install.sh" | DVM_DIR=~/deno/dvm bash
./install.sh -d ~/deno/dvm
```

### Upgrade DVM

Since DVM `v0.3.0`, we provided `upgrade` command to update your DVM to the latest version.

```sh
dvm upgrade
```

If you want to update the DVM that less than `v0.3.0`, you may need to uninstall the current version and re-install the latest version. You can get the uninstall steps from [Manual uninstall](#manual-uninstall) section.

## Getting Start

After installed dvm, you can use it to manage multiple version Deno environments.

### List available versions

Use `dvm list-remote` or `dvm ls-remote` to list all available versions from remote.

```sh
# list all available versions
dvm list-remote
# ls-remote is an alias for list-remote command
dvm ls-remote
```

### List installed versions

Use `dvm list` or `dvm ls` to list all installed versions.

```sh
# list all installed versions
dvm list
# ls command is an alias for list command
dvm ls
```

### Install Deno

Use `dvm install <version>` command to download and install a specified version from the source.

```sh
dvm install v1.0.0
deno v1.0.0 has installed.
dvn install v0.42.0
deno v0.42.0 has installed.
```

### Uninstall Deno

Use `dvm uninstall <version|alias-name>` command to uninstall a specified version.

```sh
dvm uninstall v0.39.0
uninstalled deno v0.39.0.
# default is an alias name
dvm uninstall default
uninstalled deno default.
```

### Set active version

Use `dvm use [version]` command to link `deno` to the specified installed version by parameter or `.dvmrc` file.

```sh
# use v1.0.0
dvm use v1.0.0
using deno v1.0.0 now.

# get version from .dvmrc file
# cat .dvmrc
# # v1.4.0
dvm use
using deno v1.4.0 now.
```

### Get current version

Use `dvm current` command to display the current version of Deno.

```sh
dvm current
v1.0.0
```

### Set an alias

Use `dvm alias` command to set alias name for a installed version of Deno.

```sh
dvm ls
   v1.0.0
# Set an alias
dvm alias default v1.0.0
default -> v1.0.0
dvm ls
   v1.0.0
default -> v1.0.0
```

### Run with a version

Use `dvm run` command to run Deno on the specified version with arguments.

```sh
dvm run v1.0.0
Running with deno v1.0.0
Deno 1.0.0
exit using ctrl+d or close()
>
# Run app.ts with Deno v1.0.0
dvm run v1.0.0 app.ts
```

## Uninstalling DVM

There are two ways to remove DVM from your computer.

### Use `purge` command

You can execute `dvm purge` to remove dvm from your computer if your dvm version is `v0.3.2` and above. It will remove the `$DVM_DIR` and dvm configurations in shell config file.

If your dvm is less than `v0.3.2`, please following the next section ([Manual uninstall](#manual-uninstall)) to remove DVM.

### Manual uninstall

You can also execute following command to uninstall dvm:

```sh
rm -rf "$DVM_DIR"
```

Edit shell config file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), and remove the following lines:

```sh
# Deno Version Manager
export DVM_DIR="$HOME/.dvm"
export PATH="$PATH:$DVM_BIN"
[ -f "$DVM_DIR/dvm.sh" ] && . "$DVM_DIR/dvm.sh"
[ -f "$DVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && . "$DVM_DIR/bash_completion"
