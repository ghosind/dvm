$ ./install.sh ~/deno/dvm
```

## Getting Start

After installed dvm, you can use it to manage multiple version Deno environments.

Use `dvm install <version>` command to download and install a specified version from the source.

```sh
$ dvm install v1.0.0
$ dvn install v0.42.0
```

Use `dvm uninstall <version>` command to uninstall a specified version.

```
$ dvm uninstall v0.39.0
$ dvm uninstall v1.0.0-rc
```

Use `dvm use [version]` command to link `deno` to the specified version by parameter or `.dvmrc` file.

```sh
# use v1.0.0
$ dvm use v1.0.0

# get version from .dvmrc file
# $ cat .dvmrc
# # v1.0.0
$ dvm use
```

Use `dvm current` command to display the current version of deno.

```sh
$ dvm current
# v1.0.0
```

Use `dvm ls` command to list all installed versions, and use `dvm ls-remote` to list all available versions from remote.

```sh
# list all installed versions
$ dvm ls
# list is an alias for ls command
$ dvm list

# list all available versions
$ dvm ls-remote
# list-remote is an alias for ls-remote command
$ dvm list-remote
```

Use `dvm run` command to run Deno on the specified version with arguments.

```sh
# Run app.ts with Deno v1.0.0
$ dvm run v1.0.0 app.ts
```

Use `dvm upgrade` command to update dvm itself (Since v0.3.0).

```sh
$ dvm upgrade
```
